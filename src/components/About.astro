		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p class="about-text">
			I'm a 24 year old software developer based in Scottsdale, Arizona. I appreciate real
			world problem solving, turning ideas into systems, and making things that
			people actually use, whether it's a full-stack web app, a Windows desktop
			tool, or a small game. <br />
			<br />
			With a BS in Software Development from Grand Canyon University, I have a solid
			foundation in programming principles and best practices. I'm experienced in
			C# and TypeScript, and with frameworks like Angular and .NET. I'm always eager
			to learn new technologies and improve my skills. <br />
			<br />
			When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games. I find that most of my projects
			stem from ideas and inspirations drawn from games I've played over the years.
			The classic website creation is just a product of my drive to learn and practice
			real applications of software development as much as possible.
